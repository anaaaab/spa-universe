    <h1>The Universe’s History</h1>
    <p align="justify">
        The origin, evolution, and nature of the universe have fascinated and confounded humankind for centuries. New ideas and major discoveries made during the 20th century transformed cosmology although much remains unknown. For many years, scientists thought the universe’s current expansion was slowing down. Future research may yield new surprises, but cosmologists suggest it’s likely the universe will continue to expand forever.
